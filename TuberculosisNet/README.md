TB-XNet is a lightweight deep learning model designed to detect Tuberculosis (TB) from chest X-ray images using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). It is optimized for deployment on resource-constrained devices such as mobile phones and embedded systems. This project was inspired by DarwinAI’s TuberculosisNet, but redesigned, restructured, and simplified for educational purposes and clarity.

## 🔍 Motivation

This project is part of my ongoing journey into medical AI and deep learning. After exploring various architectures and datasets, I customized this pipeline to better understand how CNNs can be applied to real-world medical imaging problems like tuberculosis screening.

> 🚨 Tuberculosis is a leading cause of death in developing countries, and early detection through AI can save lives.
